# Simple Coffee List

This is my solution for the **"Simple Coffee List"** challenge. I used Vue 3 with the Composition API to build this web app. For styling, I used vanilla CSS. This challenge helped me practice passing props to components and fetching data from an API.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue 3**: Leveraged the Composition API for component-based architecture.
- **CSS**: Styled the application using vanilla CSS.

## Features

- **Component Communication**: Practiced passing props between components.
- **Data Fetching**: Implemented data fetching from an external API to populate the coffee list.

## Getting Started
